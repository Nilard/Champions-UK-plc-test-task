To implement this task I used SQLite database so please have the 'sqlite3' PHP extension to be installed on your environment where you're going to set up the website.

I included database and files into this repository for you to quick run the website. Usually such data shouldn't be included in a repository.

Please run 'composer install' command after pulling the repository and 'drush cr' from the 'web/sites/default' directory.

No other actions after the set up is required to run the website (in theory, if anything goes wrong please contact me by email nilard@gmail.com).

Thank you.
